# Environment Variables Setup

## ✅ Configuration Complete

The `.env.local` file has been created with your Supabase credentials:

- **URL**: https://yviavhfpvufbgughpwsd.supabase.co
- **Anon Key**: Configured

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Your Dev Server

**IMPORTANT**: Next.js only loads environment variables when it starts. You need to restart your dev server.

If your dev server is running:
1. Stop it (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
2. Start it again: `npm run dev`

### 2. Verify Connection

After restarting, visit:
- http://localhost:3000/test-sku - Test SKU fetching
- http://localhost:3000/order-list - Main order list page

The error should be resolved!

## File Location

The `.env.local` file is in your project root:
```
C:\Users\dncl-sta11\Documents\DNCL-Supply\.env.local
```

This file is gitignored (as it should be) and contains your sensitive credentials.
